# Data Processing

Data processing happens with Python scripts that use various pieces of the
`DUGSeis` package. This makes it very flexible and easy to extend.

This heavily commented script demonstrates it. To use it, copy it to a file
`run_processing.py`, make the necessary adjustments to your project and call it
with

```bash
python run_processing.py
```

```{literalinclude} ../scripts/run_processing.py
   :language: py
```
